Common approaches to measuring similarity include:\n\n- **Cosine Similarity**: This method measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors (in this case, customer profiles). A higher cosine similarity indicates that two customers are more similar.\n\n   Formula for Cosine Similarity:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Similarity} = \\frac{{\\text{A} \\cdot \\text{B}}}{{\\|\\text{A}\\| \\cdot \\|\\text{B}\\|}}\n   \\]\n   Where:\n   - \\(\\text{A}\\) and \\(\\text{B}\\) are the feature vectors for two customers.\n   - The numerator is the dot product of the vectors.\n   - The denominator is the product of the magnitudes of the vectors.\n\n- **Euclidean Distance**: Another option is calculating the Euclidean distance between customers' profiles. However, cosine similarity is often preferred for recommendation tasks as it is not sensitive to the magnitude of values (only to the direction).\n\nWe compute the similarity between a given customer's vector and every other customer's vector using these measures. The result is a matrix where each entry represents the similarity between two customers.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Importing libraries","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import pandas as pd\nfrom sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity\nfrom sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\nimport numpy as np","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-27T12:39:02.501067Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-27T12:39:02.501474Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-27T12:39:02.507185Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-27T12:39:02.501447Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-27T12:39:02.505831Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":15},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Loading Dataset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"\n# Load the datasets if needed\ncustomers_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/ecommerce-transactions-dataset1/Customers.csv')\nproducts_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/ecommerce-transactions-dataset1/Products.csv')\ntransactions_df = pd.read_csv('/kaggle/input/ecommerce-transactions-dataset1/Transactions.csv')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.134605Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.135044Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.167436Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.135014Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.166326Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"products_df['Category'] = products_df['Category'].astype('category')\ntransactions_df['TransactionDate'] = pd.to_datetime(transactions_df['TransactionDate'])","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.742330Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.743014Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.753864Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.742952Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-27T12:39:03.752876Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":17},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Merge Datset","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Merge the datasets\ntransactions_products = pd.merge(transactions_df, products_df, on='ProductID', how='inner')\nfull_data = pd.merge(transactions_products, customers_df, on='CustomerID', how='inner')","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-27T12:39:06.046988Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-27T12:39:06.047408Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-27T12:39:06.062500Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-27T12:39:06.047378Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-27T12:39:06.061065Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":18},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Create Customer-Product Interaction Matrix","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Create a Customer-Product matrix (transactions data)\ncustomer_product_matrix = full_data.pivot_table(index='CustomerID', columns='ProductID', values='Quantity', aggfunc='sum', fill_value=0)\n\n# Scale the matrix for better similarity calculation (optional)\nscaler = StandardScaler()\ncustomer_product_matrix_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(customer_product_matrix)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-27T12:39:24.584235Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-27T12:39:24.584654Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-27T12:39:24.606785Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-27T12:39:24.584626Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-27T12:39:24.605350Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":19},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Calculate Similarity (Collaborative Filtering)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Calculate cosine similarity between customers\ncosine_sim = cosine_similarity(customer_product_matrix_scaled)\ncosine_sim_df = pd.DataFrame(cosine_sim, index=customer_product_matrix.index, columns=customer_product_matrix.index)","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-01-27T12:39:25.251583Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-01-27T12:39:25.252022Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-01-27T12:39:25.259616Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-01-27T12:39:25.251993Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-01-27T12:39:25.258096Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Calculate Profile-Based Similarity (Content-Based)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Convert categorical columns (e.g., Region) into numerical values\nprofile_data = customers_df[['CustomerID', 'Region']]  #
